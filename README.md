# LLM Projects

Welcome to the repository dedicated to projects based on large language models (LLMs). Here you will find resources and tools for developing, training, and applying LLMs to a variety of tasks. Projects are aimed at improving natural language processing capabilities, applications in real-world scenarios, and research and experimentation with models.

- ## Sentiment Analysis

  NLP Python Project Sentiment Analysis classifier with NLTK's VADER and Huggingface Roberta Transformers. The project is to classify the seniment of amazon customer reviews. Hugging Face provides some great open source models for NLP. We will look at the difference between model outputs from the two packages and compare the results. Developed a web API service to analyze a user's request.
